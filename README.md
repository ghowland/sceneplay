## ScenePlay

To run you must have Python 2.6 or greater installed, with PyGame.

Run with:

python2.6 owr.py nomusic

Currently no music file is specified, which is done manually by placing at ./data/music.wav

Commands:

 - Right/Left arrows: move timeline forward backward
 - Up/Down arrows: faster timeline movement
 - Shift Right/Left arrows: move to Scene markers

Actor placement is done by changing their controls using the UI buttons and mouse.

This is going to be confusing if you aren't me, as I didn't make this to be easy to use yet.

Consider this "as is" software that probably wont help you.  This will change as I get more time to work on this project in the future.
