  #   chains.  >>, sends a run burst, then uppercut, then >> and run more,

  #   time them all as theyre flying all over the place.  RAD!

  # Turns it into a real show, and trying to time things in advance.  Totally
  #   will improve network play, and allow more people to play, because moves
  #   are lagged, but synced, for everyone.
  #
  # Can cheoreograph fights with scripting system, so that I can test that the
  #   logic will work well.  By the time it looks good, input mapping should
  #   be able to make them do the moves as well.
  #
  # Allow direct controls, and stacked.  Shouldnt be too difficult to abstract
  #   and just make a menu or start button to switch.  Unless people do it
  #   often.  Mapped button for this would be best.
