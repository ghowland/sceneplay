#TODO: Change this so that actors are constantly being re-populated per "at:" statement, will solve
#   most of my problems.  Not as easy to type, but much easier to work with the Scene and Change Point model.
#
#   - Will need to add in an "add actor" button, and then select the animation spec, and other stuff

  actors:
    camera:
      handler: camera
      render: false

        watch: alex

# Reset all actors per scene.  Scene changes are new.  Specify when the scene changes occur with AT.
#   Best to precise with scene changes, for now.  Can make it more flexible once Im in the new method.

# Current actor definitions are still good for the final output of rendering the actors, the Behaviour
#   Handler code (person, etc) will determine what the actor is doing based on the goals, and then generate
#   each actor pos/action/data/etc.

# Name the scenes, for easy of editing and scrolling through things once I have developed the UI modes.
